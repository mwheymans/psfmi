Description:
	Provides functions to apply pooling or backward selection 
	for logistic, Cox regression and Multilevel (mixed models) prediction 
	models in multiply imputed datasets. Backward selection can be done 
	from the pooled model using Rubin's Rules (RR), the D1, D2, D3 and 
	promising MPR (median p-values) method. The model can contain 
	continuous, dichotomous, categorical predictors and interaction terms 
	between all	these type of predictors. Continuous predictors	can also 
	be introduced as restricted cubic spline (RCS) coefficients. It is also possible 
	to force (spline) predictors or interaction terms in the model during predictor 
	selection. The package also included a function to evaluate the stability 
	of the models	using bootstrapping and cluster bootstrapping. The package further 
	contains functions to generate pooled model performance measures in imputed datasets 
	as ROC/AUC, R-squares, fit test values and calibration	plots for logistic 
	regression models. A function to apply Bootstrap internal validation	
	is also available where two methods can be used to combine bootstrapping and
	multiple imputationfor internal validation. One method, boot_MI, first draws 
	bootstrap samples and	subsequently performs multiple imputation and with 
	the other method, MI_boot, first bootstrap samples are drawn from each imputed 
	dataset before results are combined. Backward selection	as part of internal 
	validation is also an option. Also a function to externally validate logistic 
	prediction models in multiple imputed datasets is available.
