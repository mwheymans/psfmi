Description:
	Pooling, backward and forward selection of linear, logistic and Cox regression models in 
	multiply imputed datasets. Backward and forward selection can be done 
	from the pooled model using Rubin's Rules (RR), the D1, D2, D3, D4 and 
	the median p-values method. This is also possible for Mixed models. 
	The models can contain continuous, dichotomous, categorical and restricted 
	cubic spline predictors and interaction terms between	all these type of predictors. 
	The stability of the models	can be evaluated using bootstrapping and cluster 
	bootstrapping. The package further contains functions to pool the model performance 
	as ROC/AUC, R-squares, scaled Brier score, H&L test and calibration	plots for logistic 
	regression models. Internal validation can be	done with cross-validation or bootstrapping. 
	The adjusted intercept after shrinkage of pooled regression coefficients can be obtained. 
	Backward and forward selection as part of internal validation is possible. 
	A function to externally validate logistic prediction models in multiple imputed 
	datasets is available and a function to compare models.
