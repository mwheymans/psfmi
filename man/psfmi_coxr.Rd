\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with stacked multiple imputed datasets.
The original dataset that contains missing values must be excluded from the
dataset. The imputed datasets must be distinguished by an imputation variable,
specified under impvar, and starting by 1.}

\item{formula}{A formula object to specify the model as normally used by coxph.
See under "Details" and "Examples" how these can be specified. If a formula
object is used set predictors, cat.predictors, spline.predictors or int.predictors
at the default value of NULL.}

\item{nimp}{A numerical scalar. Number of imputed datasets. Default is 5.}

\item{impvar}{A character vector. Name of the variable that distinguishes the
imputed datasets.}

\item{time}{Survival time.}

\item{status}{The status variable, normally 0=censoring, 1=event.}

\item{predictors}{Character vector with the names of the predictor variables.
At least one predictor variable has to be defined. Give predictors unique names
and do not use predictor name combinations with numbers as, age2, gnder10, etc.}

\item{cat.predictors}{A single string or a vector of strings to define the
categorical variables. Default is NULL categorical predictors.}

\item{spline.predictors}{A single string or a vector of strings to define the
(restricted cubic) spline variables. Default is NULL spline predictors. See details.}

\item{int.predictors}{A single string or a vector of strings with the names of the variables that form
an interaction pair, separated by a “:” symbol.}

\item{keep.predictors}{A single string or a vector of strings including the variables that are forced
in the model during predictor selection. Categorical and interaction variables are allowed.}

\item{strata.variable}{A single string including the strata variable. See under "Details" 
and "Examples" how such a variable can be specified.}

\item{nknots}{A numerical vector that defines the number of knots for each spline predictor separately.}

\item{p.crit}{A numerical scalar. P-value selection criterion. A value of 1
provides the pooled model without selection.}

\item{method}{A character vector to indicate the pooling method for p-values to pool the
total model or used during predictor selection. This can be "RR", D1", "D2", or "MPR".
See details for more information. Default is "RR".}

\item{direction}{The direction of predictor selection, "BW" means backward selection and "FW"
means forward selection.}

\description{
\code{psfmi_coxr} Pooling and backward or forward selection of Cox regression
prediction models in multiply imputed data using selection methods D1, D2 and MPR.
}
\details{
The basic pooling procedure to derive pooled coefficients, standard errors, 95
 confidence intervals and p-values is Rubin's Rules (RR). However, RR is only possible when
 the model included continuous or dichotomous variables. Specific procedures are
 available when the model also included categorical (> 2 categories) or restricted cubic spline
 variables. These pooling methods are: “D1” is pooling of the total covariance matrix,
 ”D2” is pooling of Chi-square values and “MPR” is pooling of median p-values (MPR rule).
 Spline regression coefficients are defined by using the rcs function for restricted cubic
 splines of the rms package. A minimum number of 3 knots as defined under knots is required.

 A typical formula object has the form \code{Surv(time, status) ~ terms}. Categorical variables has to
 be defined as \code{Surv(time, status) ~ factor(variable)}, restricted cubic spline variables as
 \code{Surv(time, status) ~ rcs(variable, 3)}. Interaction terms can be defined as
 \code{Surv(time, status) ~ variable1*variable2} or \code{Surv(time, status) ~ variable1 + variable2 + 
 variable1:variable2}. All variables in the terms part have to be separated by a "+". If a formula
 object is used set predictors, cat.predictors, spline.predictors or int.predictors
 at the default value of NULL. For Cox models also a strata variable is allowed to include in 
 the formula as \code{Surv(time, status) ~ strata(variable) + terms}.
