\title{Pooling performance measures across multiply imputed datasets}
\usage{
pool_performance(
  data,
  formula,
  nimp,
  impvar,
  plot.indiv,
  model_type = "binomial",
  cal.plot = TRUE,
  plot.method = "mean",
  groups_cal = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with stacked multiple imputed datasets.
The original dataset that contains missing values must be excluded 
from the dataset.}

\item{formula}{A formula object to specify the model as normally used by glm
or coxph. See details.}

\item{nimp}{A numerical scalar. Number of imputed datasets. Default is 5.}

\item{impvar}{A character vector. Name of the variable that distinguishes 
the imputed datasets.}

\item{plot.indiv}{This argument is deprecated; please use plot.method instead.}

\item{model_type}{If "binomial" (default), performance measures are calculated
for logistic regression models, if "survival" for Cox regression models. See details.}

\item{cal.plot}{If TRUE a calibration plot is generated. Default is TRUE. 
model_type must be "binomial".}

\item{plot.method}{If "mean" one calibration plot is generated, first taking the 
mean of the linear predictor across the multiply imputed datasets (default), if 
"individual" the calibration plot of each imputed dataset is plotted, 
if "overlay" calibration plots from each imputed datasets are plotted in one figure.}

\item{groups_cal}{A numerical scalar. Number of groups used on the calibration plot and. 
for the Hosmer and Lemeshow test. Default is 10. If the range of predicted probabilities. 
is low, less than 10 groups can be chosen, but not < 3.}

\description{
\code{pool_performance} Pooling performance measures for logistic
 and Cox regression models.
}
\details{
A typical formula object for logistic regression models has the form 
  \code{formula = Outcome ~ terms}. For Cox regression models the formula object must
  be defined as \code{Surv(time, status) ~ terms}. For Cox models calibration curves 
  can not be generated.
